TweetCloud is a web application for organising  tweets  using  visualisation. For  people  who  follow  hundreds, sometimes it might be nice to just get a summary of what everyone is talking about.  TweetCloud extracts all  tweets/re-tweets on your twitter timeline and renders this in an aesthetic tag  cloud!  A  user  can  then interactively click on each word and he or she can see the individual tweets were this word was mentioned.
